- **Date**: October 1, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ Approved
- **Purpose**: Initial brainstorming and concept development for proactive list management

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Manual List Cleanup**
- Bounce rates accumulate over time, damaging sender reputation
- Lists become unbalanced after suppressing bounced contacts
- No visibility into list health week-to-week
- Manual cleanup is error-prone and time-consuming
- No clear audit trail of why changes were made

**Inconsistent List Maintenance**
- Ad-hoc suppression of bounced contacts
- No standardized timing for list rebalancing
- Missing round-to-round optimization opportunities
- Difficult to track list quality trends over time

**Lack of AI-Powered Insights**
- Manual analysis of which contacts to suppress
- No intelligent rebalancing recommendations
- Missing predictions about future list health
- Difficult to understand optimal list distribution

**List Management Challenges**
- Maintaining three campaign lists with equal distribution
- Coordinating with master user list (source of truth)
- Managing suppression list without losing data
- Preserving FIFO integrity while rebalancing
- Caching list metadata for fast access

---

## Vision

### What We Want to Build

**Fully Automated List Management System** that provides:

1. **Proactive Maintenance** - AI analyzes and cleans lists after each campaign
2. **Intelligent Rebalancing** - Optimal redistribution across three campaign lists
3. **Weekly Health Reports** - AI-powered insights into list quality trends
4. **Complete Transparency** - Every decision explained with AI rationale
5. **Seamless Integration** - Extends existing campaign lifecycle (adds Stage 6)

## Core Concept

### The List Hierarchy

```
Master User List (5776)
  ↓
[Source of truth - all registered users]
  ↓
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ List 1  │ List 2  │ List 3  │ (Campaign rotation)
│ Tue     │ Thu     │ Next Tu │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
  ↓
Suppression List (10503500)
[Hard bounces - never send]
```

### The 4 AI Agents

```
ListManagementOrchestrator
  ↓
┌──────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
│Health│Rebalance│Optimize  │Report   │
│Agent │Agent    │Agent     │Agent    │
└──────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────┘
  ↓
Gemini 2.0 Flash API
```

### The 3 Automated Workflows

**1. Post-Campaign Maintenance (T+24h)**
- Analyze bounces from completed campaign
- AI recommends contacts to suppress
- Execute suppression + rebalancing
- Log everything with AI rationale

**2. Weekly Health Check (Mondays 10 AM UTC)**
- Sync all lists from Mailjet
- AI analyzes list health
- Generate executive report
- Alert on critical issues

**3. Pre-Campaign Validation (Enhanced Pre-Flight)**
- Verify list size matches expectations
- Check for suppressed contacts in list
- AI assessment of list quality
- Flag concerns before launch

---

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Driven Analysis

**List Health Agent**
- Analyzes bounce rates, delivery rates, list size
- Compares to industry benchmarks
- Assesses sender reputation impact
- Determines urgency (low/medium/high)

**Rebalancing Agent**
- Calculates optimal distribution across 3 lists
- Minimizes contact movement
- Preserves FIFO integrity
- Explains rationale for each decision

**Optimization Agent**
- Identifies hard bounces for immediate suppression
- Flags repeated soft bouncers for monitoring
- Keeps temporary bounces in list
- Predicts delivery rate improvements

**Reporting Agent**
- Generates executive-level weekly reports
- Highlights positive developments
- Lists action items by priority
- Week-over-week trend analysis

### 2. Automated List Maintenance

**Post-Campaign Workflow**
```
Campaign Complete (T+0)
  ↓
Wait 24 hours (bounce processing)
  ↓
Fetch bounce data from Mailjet
  ↓
AI analyzes → suppression plan
  ↓
Execute suppression
  ↓
AI generates → rebalancing plan
  ↓
Execute rebalancing
  ↓
Update Redis cache
  ↓
Log to database
  ↓
Send Slack report
```

**Weekly Health Check**
```
Every Monday 10 AM UTC
  ↓
Sync all lists from Mailjet
  ↓
Update Redis cache
  ↓
Calculate list metrics
  ↓
AI analyzes each list
  ↓
Generate weekly report
  ↓
Check for critical issues
  ↓
Send Slack notification
  ↓
Log to database
```

### 3. Redis Cache Layer

**What's Cached:**
- List metadata (size, bounce rates, last synced)
- Campaign list sizes
- Suppression list size
- Health status flags
- Rebalancing queue

**Cache Strategy:**
- TTL: 1 hour
- On-demand updates (campaign access)
- Scheduled sync (hourly background)
- Invalidate on modifications

### 4. Complete Transparency

**Database Logging**
- `ListMaintenanceLog` - Post-campaign maintenance records
- `ListHealthCheck` - Weekly health check snapshots
- `ContactSuppressionHistory` - Individual suppression audit trail

**AI Rationale Storage**
- Every agent decision stored with rationale
- Confidence scores tracked
- Before/after states captured
- Change summaries generated

**Slack Notifications**
- Post-campaign maintenance report
- Weekly health check report
- Critical issue alerts
- All include AI assessments

### 5. Best Practices Enforcement

**Never Delete from Master List**
- Master list = source of truth
- Only add new users
- Use suppression list for exclusions

**Suppress, Don't Delete**
- Hard bounces → immediate suppression
- 3+ soft bounces → suppression
- Keep full audit trail

**Rebalance Within 24-48 Hours**
- After bounce data stabilizes
- Maintain ±5% balance tolerance
- Preserve FIFO ordering

## User Stories

### As a Marketing Manager

**Post-Campaign Cleanup**
> "I want the system to automatically clean up bounced contacts after each campaign, so I don't have to manually review bounce reports."

**Weekly Health Visibility**
> "I want to receive a weekly report showing the health of our campaign lists, so I can proactively address issues before they impact campaigns."

**Transparent Decisions**
> "I want to understand why AI decided to suppress or rebalance contacts, so I can trust the automation and explain decisions to stakeholders."

### As a Campaign Operator

**Automated Rebalancing**
> "I want campaign lists to automatically rebalance after cleanup, so all three lists stay roughly equal in size for fair distribution."

**Pre-Campaign Validation**
> "I want pre-flight checks to verify list health before launch, so I know if there are any concerns about the target list."

**Error Handling**
> "I want the system to handle partial failures gracefully (e.g., some contacts suppressed, some failed), so campaigns aren't blocked unnecessarily."

### As a Product Owner

**Historical Tracking**
> "I want all list management actions logged with AI rationale, so I can analyze trends and improve our processes over time."

**Performance Metrics**
> "I want to track bounce rates, delivery rates, and list balance over time, so I can measure the impact of automated list management."

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Layers

**1. AI Agent Layer**
- Custom TypeScript classes (not framework)
- Shared GeminiClient instance
- Parallel execution with Promise.all()
- Specialized prompts per agent

**2. Workflow Orchestration Layer**
- ListManagementOrchestrator class

- Context-aware recommendations
- Explains reasoning in natural language
- Learns from historical patterns

**Why Redis Cache?**
- Fast list metadata access
- Reduces Mailjet API calls
- Hourly TTL balances freshness vs performance
- Invalidated on modifications

**Why 24-Hour Post-Campaign Delay?**
- Bounces take time to process
- Mailjet metrics stabilize

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Mailjet API Rate Limits**
- Risk: Exceed API limits during list sync
- Mitigation: Cache aggressively, respect rate limits, batch requests

**Gemini AI Timeout**
- Risk: AI analysis takes > 30 seconds
- Mitigation: Timeout + fallback to rule-based decisions

**Redis Cache Failure**
- Risk: Cache unavailable during critical operation
- Mitigation: Fallback to direct Mailjet API, alert team

**Database Migration Issues**
- Risk: New schema breaks existing lifecycle
- Mitigation: Backward-compatible migrations, staging tests

### Operational Risks

**Over-Suppression**
- Risk: AI suppresses legitimate contacts
- Mitigation: Conservative thresholds, human review option, audit trail

**Rebalancing Errors**
- Risk: Contact movement breaks FIFO order
- Mitigation: Validation checks, rollback capability, manual override

**Slack Notification Failures**
- Risk: Critical alerts not delivered
- Mitigation: Retry logic (3 attempts), fallback channel, email alerts

### Business Risks

**False Sense of Security**
- Risk: Team stops monitoring because "AI handles it"
- Mitigation: Weekly reports emphasize human oversight, critical alerts

**Integration Complexity**
- Risk: List management interferes with campaign lifecycle
- Mitigation: Stage 6 is optional initially, can disable per campaign

- ✅ How to handle partial failures? → Accept partial success, retry failed
- ✅ Where to log AI decisions? → Database (ListMaintenanceLog) + Slack
- ✅ When to rebalance? → T+24h post-campaign (after bounces stabilize)
- ✅ How to preserve FIFO? → Track contact IDs, maintain order during moves

**To Be Resolved During Implementation:**
- How to handle Mailjet downtime during weekly health check?
- Should we add manual override UI for AI decisions?
- What triggers should pause automation? (e.g., holidays, system issues)
- How to handle growing master list (>10,000 contacts)?

# Campaign Manager Agent - Requirements Brainstorm

## Document Information
- Version: 1.0
- Date: 2025-09-20
- Status: Active
- Purpose: Define the Campaign Manager Agent for pre-campaign coordination
- Focus: Campaign scheduling, content coordination, and team management

## Executive Summary

The Campaign Manager Agent is responsible for the operational aspects of campaign execution - ensuring campaigns are prepared on time, content is ready, teams are coordinated, and schedules are maintained. While the Marketing Agent handles post-campaign analytics and attribution, the Campaign Manager Agent owns the pre-campaign workflow and execution readiness.

## Core Purpose

### Primary Objectives
1. **Schedule Management**: Maintain and enforce campaign calendar
2. **Content Coordination**: Track content creation and approval workflows
3. **Team Orchestration**: Coordinate between content, design, and marketing teams
4. **Deadline Enforcement**: Proactive reminders and escalations
5. **Readiness Validation**: Pre-flight checks before campaign launch

### Key Problems Solved
- Campaigns missing deadlines due to lack of coordination
- Content bottlenecks not identified until too late
- No central visibility into campaign preparation status
- Manual tracking of multiple campaign workflows
- Lack of proactive notifications for pending tasks

## Temporal Focus

**Campaign Manager Agent**: Future/Present (Pre-Campaign)
- What needs to happen
- Who needs to do it
- When it needs to be done
- Is it on track

**Marketing Agent**: Present/Past (Post-Campaign)
- What happened
- How it performed
- What was the ROI
- How to optimize

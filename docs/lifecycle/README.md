# Automated Campaign Lifecycle Management

## Overview

This directory contains complete documentation for the **Automated Campaign Lifecycle Management** feature - a comprehensive system that automates campaign execution with AI-powered insights, pre-flight verification, and multi-stage notifications.

## What is Campaign Lifecycle Management?

A fully automated system that manages campaigns from scheduling through post-launch analysis, providing stakeholders with real-time visibility and AI-powered recommendations at every critical stage.

### The 5-Stage Lifecycle

```
1. Pre-Launch Notification (T-21 hours)
   ‚Üì
2. Pre-Flight Check (T-3.25 hours)
   ‚Üì
3. Launch Warning (T-15 minutes)
   ‚Üì
4. Launch Confirmation (T+0)
   ‚Üì
5. Post-Launch Wrap-Up (T+30 minutes)
```

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Automated Scheduling** - Split campaigns into thirds, schedule on Tue/Thu
‚úÖ **Pre-Flight Verification** - Automated checks catch issues before launch
‚úÖ **AI-Powered Analysis** - Multi-agent system provides insights & recommendations

## Key Concepts

### Campaign Batch Strategy
- **Split into 3 rounds**: Every campaign divided into thirds
- **Scheduling**: Only Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:15 AM UTC
- **FIFO ordering**: Recipients ordered by ContactID for fair distribution

### 5-Stage Lifecycle
1. **Pre-Launch (T-21h)**: Advance notice with campaign details + AI preview
2. **Pre-Flight (T-3.25h)**: Automated verification of list, campaign, technical config
3. **Launch Warning (T-15min)**: Final countdown notification
4. **Launch Confirmation (T+0)**: Immediate feedback with initial stats
5. **Wrap-Up (T+30min)**: Complete metrics + AI analysis + recommendations

### AI Multi-Agent System
- **List Quality Agent**: Analyzes bounce rates and list health
- **Delivery Analysis Agent**: Evaluates delivery performance
- **Comparison Agent**: Compares rounds for trends
- **Recommendation Agent**: Generates actionable recommendations
- **Report Formatting Agent**: Formats insights for Slack

## FAQ

**Q: Why split into 3 batches?**
A: Reduces risk, allows learning between rounds, limits impact of issues, enables optimization.

**Q: Why Tuesday and Thursday only?**
A: Mid-week days have optimal engagement. Avoids Monday (low) and Friday (weekend proximity).

**Q: Why 30 minutes for wrap-up?**
A: Allows time for email delivery, bounce processing, and MailJet metrics to stabilize.

**Q: Can I change the schedule after creation?**
A: Yes, via database updates. Future enhancement will add UI for this.

**Q: What happens if pre-flight check fails?**
A: Campaign status set to BLOCKED, notification sent with details, manual intervention required.

**Q: Can I skip a stage?**
A: Not recommended. Each stage serves a critical purpose in the lifecycle.

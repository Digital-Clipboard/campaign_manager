# Multi-Agent Campaign Manager Enhancement

## Implementation Summary

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Testing
**Version:** 1.1.0 - AI-Enhanced Reporting

---

## Overview

This implementation enhances the Campaign Manager with a multi-agent architecture for AI-powered campaign analysis and executive reporting. The system now uses Google Gemini AI to transform raw MailJet campaign statistics into actionable executive insights.

## What Changed

### 1. Notification Timing Updates ✅

**File:** `src/services/scheduling/campaign-scheduler.service.ts`

Updated campaign notification schedule from:
- Monday 4pm → **Monday 3am UTC** (day before notification)
- Tuesday 7am → **Tuesday 6am UTC** (morning checks)
- Tuesday 9:45am → **Tuesday 9am UTC** (15-min countdown)
- Tuesday 10:10am → **Tuesday 9:30am UTC** (post-launch report)

**Launch time changed:** 10:00 AM UTC → **9:15 AM UTC**

**File:** `scripts/populate-week-schedule.js`

Updated database schedule entries to match new timing for:
- Week 40, 2025 campaigns (Tuesday Round 2, Thursday Round 3)
- All notification types aligned with new UTC schedule

### 2. AI Agent Architecture ✅

#### Campaign Analytics Agent
**File:** `src/services/agents/campaign-analytics.agent.ts`

**Purpose:** Analyze campaign performance using Google Gemini AI

**Capabilities:**
- Connects to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Analyzes MailJet campaign statistics
- Compares performance vs. benchmarks
- Identifies trends and anomalies
- Generates actionable insights
- Provides fallback analysis if AI unavailable

**Key Features:**
- Industry benchmark comparison (Delivery 95%+, Open 25%+, Click 3%+)
- Previous round comparison for trend analysis
- Prioritized insights (critical → warning → positive)
- Performance scoring (0-100)
- Executive-level recommendations

#### Report Formatting Agent
**File:** `src/services/agents/report-formatting.agent.ts`

**Purpose:** Transform AI insights into executive-ready reports

**Capabilities:**
- Formats analysis for Slack (rich blocks)
- Creates plain text summaries
- Prioritizes top 3 insights by impact
- Generates one-line executive summary
- Applies consistent visual indicators (🟢 🟡 🔴)

**Key Features:**
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Performance trends comparison
- Actionable recommendations
- Detailed metrics breakdown
- Fallback formatting if processing fails

#### Campaign Report Orchestrator
**File:** `src/services/agents/campaign-report-orchestrator.ts`

**Purpose:** Coordinate the full reporting workflow

**Workflow:**
1. Fetch campaign statistics from MailJet (if not provided)
2. Pass to Analytics Agent → receive insights
3. Pass insights to Formatting Agent → receive report
4. Return formatted report ready for Slack

**Features:**
- Graceful degradation (fallback to basic report if AI fails)
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Integration with Campaign Lifecycle ✅

**File:** `src/jobs/campaign-lifecycle.jobs.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added imports for new agent services
- Modified `completion` notification case to use AI orchestrator
- Converts campaign statistics to MailJet format
- Invokes orchestrator for AI-enhanced reporting
- Falls back to basic notification if AI fails

**File:** `src/services/slack/campaign-notifications.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `createAIEnhancedCompletionNotification()` method
- Maintains legacy `createCompletionNotification()` for fallback
- Supports both AI-enhanced and basic notification formats

### 4. Dependencies Added ✅

**File:** `package.json`

Added: `@google/generative-ai": "^0.21.0"`

## Example Output Comparison

### Before (Basic Stats)
```
CAMPAIGN COMPLETED
Client Letter - Round 2
✓ SUCCESS

Final Statistics:
• Total Sent: 1,000
• Delivered: 970 (97%)
• Bounced: 30 (3%)
• Duration: 52 minutes
```

### After (AI-Enhanced Report)
```
📊 CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE REPORT
Client Letter - Round 2
🟢 GOOD PERFORMANCE (Score: 87/100)

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
• Delivery: 🟢 97% (above benchmark)
• Engagement: 🟡 24% open (at benchmark)
• Quality: 🟢 97%
• Emails Sent: 1,000

📊 KEY INSIGHTS
1. 🟢 DELIVERY: Excellent delivery rate - infrastructure performing well
2. 🟡 ENGAGEMENT: Open rate 2% below previous round - recommend subject line testing
3. 🟢 PERFORMANCE: Bounce rate well within acceptable range

✅ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Test alternative subject lines for Round 3 to improve engagement
2. Monitor open rates over next 24 hours for complete picture
3. Continue current send time - 09:15 UTC showing optimal delivery

📈 PERFORMANCE TRENDS
• vs Benchmark: Delivery exceeds target, engagement at industry standard
• vs Previous Round: Delivery maintained, engagement declined slightly

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env`:

```env
# Required for AI agents
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Existing (should already be configured)
MAILJET_API_KEY=your-mailjet-key
MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=your-mailjet-secret
SLACK_MANAGER_URL=your-slack-manager-url
SLACK_MANAGER_API_TOKEN=your-token
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/brianjames/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Drive/digital_clipboard/00_traction/campaign_manager

# Install new Google Generative AI package
npm install

# or specifically
npm install @google/generative-ai@^0.21.0
```

### Update Database Schedule

```bash
# Update campaign schedule in database with new times
node scripts/populate-week-schedule.js
```

---

## Testing Plan

### 1. Unit Tests (Recommended)
- Test Analytics Agent with mock statistics
- Test Formatting Agent output structure
- Test Orchestrator fallback behavior

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test with real MailJet statistics (if available)
- Verify Gemini API connectivity
- Confirm Slack notification formatting

### 3. End-to-End Test
```bash
# Send a test completion notification
node scripts/test-notification.js
```

### 4. Scheduled Job Verification
- Verify cron schedules match new times:
  - Monday 3am UTC: Preparation notification
  - Tuesday 6am UTC: Pre-launch checks
  - Tuesday 9am UTC: Launch countdown
  - Tuesday 9:15am UTC: Campaign launch
  - Tuesday 9:30am UTC: Post-launch report (with AI analysis)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the system has built-in fallbacks:

1. **AI Agent Fails:** System automatically falls back to basic notification format
2. **Timing Issues:** Revert `campaign-scheduler.service.ts` to previous commit
3. **Complete Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   npm install  # restore previous package.json
   ```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Response Times
- **AI Analysis:** ~2-5 seconds (Gemini API call)
- **Formatting:** <100ms
- **Total Overhead:** ~2-6 seconds per completion notification

### Cost
- **Gemini API:** Free tier includes 15 requests/minute, 1,500/day
- **Expected Usage:** ~2-4 completion notifications per week
- **Cost Impact:** Negligible (well within free tier)

### Monitoring
- All agent operations logged with timing
- Fallback triggers logged as warnings
- Health check endpoint available: `/api/health/agents`

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Optional)
1. **Historical Trend Analysis:** Compare performance across multiple campaigns
2. **Predictive Insights:** Forecast expected performance based on patterns
3. **A/B Test Recommendations:** Suggest specific optimization experiments
4. **Segment Analysis:** Break down performance by user segments

### Phase 3 (If Using Google ADK)
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Use Google ADK for agent coordination
2. **Streaming Reports:** Provide real-time analysis updates
3. **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** Enable agents to collaborate on complex analysis
4. **Custom Agent Workflows:** Build specialized agents for different campaign types

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set"
- **Solution:** Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env` file

**Issue:** AI analysis takes too long
- **Solution:** System has 30-second timeout, will auto-fallback to basic report

**Issue:** Notification sent but no AI insights
- **Solution:** Check logs for error messages, verify Gemini API quota

### Logs to Check
```bash
# View recent campaign notification logs
grep "campaign lifecycle" logs/app.log | tail -20

# Check for AI agent errors
grep "analytics agent" logs/app.log | tail -10

# Verify Gemini API calls
grep "Gemini" logs/app.log | tail -10
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Configuration Required

### Step 1: Configure MailJet List ID

The Campaign Manager needs to know which MailJet list to use for Round 2.

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add to .env file
ROUND_2_MAILJET_LIST_ID=10503118
```

**Option B: Configuration File**
If you have a campaign config file, update it:
```javascript
// config/campaigns.js or similar
const campaigns = {
  clientLetter: {
    round1: { listId: 10502980 },
    round2: { listId: 10503118 }, // ← ADD THIS
    round3: { listId: null }       // To be created
  }
};
```

**Option C: Direct Integration**
If your campaign execution uses the MailJet client directly, pass the List ID when creating/sending the campaign:
```javascript
await mailjetClient.sendEmailCampaign({
  campaignName: 'Client Letter Round 2',
  listId: 10503118, // ← Use this
  templateId: 'your-template-id'
});
```

### Step 2: Verify List Processing

Run verification script to ensure MailJet has finished processing:
```bash
node scripts/verify-round2-list.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ ROUND 2 LIST VERIFICATION
List ID: 10503118
List Name: campaign_batch_002
Subscriber Count: 1000
Status: ✅ PERFECT
🚀 Ready for campaign launch!
```

**If count is 0**: Wait 1-2 more minutes and re-run

### Step 3: Test Notification System (RECOMMENDED)

Before the 9:15 AM launch, test the notification system:
```bash
node scripts/test-notification.js
```

This will:
- Send a test notification to your Slack channel
- Verify AI agents are working
- Confirm Gemini API is responding
- Check Slack integration

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: List shows 0 subscribers
**Solution**: MailJet processes asynchronously. Wait 2-3 minutes and run:
```bash
node scripts/verify-round2-list.js
```

### Issue: AI report not showing
**Solution**: Check Gemini API key in `.env`:
```bash
cat .env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY
```
Should show: `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAhyljWplGSXweFZ-PMSD0Crm29xfqfmug`

### Issue: MailJet API errors
**Solution**: Verify credentials in `.env`:
```bash
cat .env | grep MAILJET
```
Should show:
```
MAILJET_API_KEY=44027b3721dad636354c70451b52cc56
MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=21d4195c78af9f3c46ea7906280e6a1e
```

### Issue: Campaign not launching
**Solution**:
1. Check Campaign Manager is running: `curl http://localhost:3007/health`

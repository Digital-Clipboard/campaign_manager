### 2. Create Round 3 Email Campaign in MailJet ⏳

**IMPORTANT**: The campaign must be created manually in the MailJet UI due to API limitations.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open MailJet Campaigns**
   Go to: https://app.mailjet.com/campaigns

2. **Create New Campaign**
   Click "Create Campaign" button

3. **Campaign Settings**
   Use these exact values (same as Round 1 & 2):

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Campaign Name** | Client Letters 2.0 Round 3 |
   | **Subject Line** | Client Letters 2.0 Compliance Automated Live |
   | **From Email** | support@digitalclipboard.com |
   | **From Name** | (leave blank or "Digital Clipboard") |
   | **Recipients** | campaign_batch_003 (List ID: 10503192) |
   | **Click Tracking** | ✅ Enabled |
   | **Open Tracking** | As preferred |

4. **Email Content**
   Two options:
   - **Option A**: Copy from Round 2 Campaign
     Visit: https://app.mailjet.com/campaign/draft/7758985090
     Copy the entire email template

   - **Option B**: Use existing newsletter template
     Select from saved templates if available

5. **Schedule Campaign**
   - **Date**: October 2, 2025
   - **Time**: 9:15 AM UTC
   - **Important**: Double-check timezone is UTC, not local time!

6. **Review & Confirm**
   - Verify list: campaign_batch_003 (10503192)
   - Verify subject matches Round 2
   - Verify scheduled time: 9:15 AM UTC Oct 2
   - Confirm tracking settings

7. **Save Campaign ID**
   After creating the campaign, note the Campaign ID from the URL:
   ```
   https://app.mailjet.com/campaign/draft/XXXXXXXXXX
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^
                                          This is your Campaign ID
   ```

---

### 3. Update Assessment Script with Campaign ID ⏳

Once you have the Campaign ID from Step 2:

```bash
# Replace XXXXXXXXXX with your actual Campaign ID
node scripts/update-round3-campaign-id.js XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Example**:
```bash
node scripts/update-round3-campaign-id.js 7759123456
```

This will automatically update `scripts/real-post-launch-assessment.ts` with the Round 3 Campaign ID.

---

### 4. Verify Campaign Setup ⏳

After updating the Campaign ID:

```bash
node scripts/verify-round3-campaign.js
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Campaign exists in MailJet
- ✅ Correct list assigned (campaign_batch_003)
- ✅ Correct subject line
- ✅ Scheduled for correct date/time
- ✅ Assessment script ready

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: List shows 0 subscribers
**Solution**: MailJet processes uploads asynchronously. Wait 2-3 minutes and run:
```bash
node scripts/verify-round3-list.js
```

### Issue: Can't find campaign ID in MailJet UI
**Solution**:
1. Go to https://app.mailjet.com/campaigns
2. Find "Client Letters 2.0 Round 3" in the list
3. Click to open it
4. Look at the URL: `https://app.mailjet.com/campaign/draft/XXXXXXXXXX`
5. The number at the end is your Campaign ID

### Issue: Don't know which template to use
**Solution**:
1. Open Round 2 campaign: https://app.mailjet.com/campaign/draft/7758985090
2. View the email content
3. Copy the exact same content to Round 3
4. Or look for a saved template named "Client Letters 2.0"

### Issue: Time zone confusion
**Solution**:
- Campaign should launch at **9:15 AM UTC**
- If you're in a different timezone, use a converter:
  - PST (UTC-8): 1:15 AM October 2
  - EST (UTC-5): 4:15 AM October 2

# Digital Clipboard Tone of Voice Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the tone of voice to be used across all Digital Clipboard client communications. Based on analysis of previous successful client interactions, we've defined a consistent, professional yet approachable style that reflects our brand values and resonates with our target audience of financial professionals.

## Core Tone Attributes

### 1. Professional & Authoritative
- **Do:** Demonstrate expertise and knowledge of the financial services industry
- **Don't:** Use jargon unnecessarily or adopt an overly academic tone
- **Example:** "We've applied industry-standard ITIL procedures to streamline the approval process" vs. "We did some stuff to make approvals faster"

### 2. Warm & Personable
- **Do:** Address clients by name and reference specific details about their situation
- **Don't:** Be overly formal or distant
- **Example:** "Hi Jessie, I saw you attended our webinar in January. Did you find the DAR demonstration helpful?" vs. "Dear client, thank you for your attendance at our recent event."

### 3. Concise & Direct
- **Do:** Get to the point quickly and organize information logically
- **Don't:** Use unnecessary preambles or meandering explanations
- **Example:** "We're experiencing email service disruption. Estimated fix: 2 hours" vs. "We wanted to let you know that there appears to be an issue with our email service, which we're currently looking into and hope to have resolved in approximately 2 hours or so."

### 4. Solution-Oriented
- **Do:** Focus on solutions, next steps, and positive outcomes
- **Don't:** Dwell on problems without offering clear paths forward
- **Example:** "We've identified the cause and are implementing a fix. In the meantime, here's an alternative approach..." vs. "Unfortunately, there's an issue that's preventing the system from working correctly."

### 5. Data-Backed & Specific
- **Do:** Use specific numbers, metrics, and examples to illustrate points
- **Don't:** Make vague claims without supporting evidence
- **Example:** "This approach reduces process time by 40% (from 150 minutes to 90 minutes per case)" vs. "This approach saves a lot of time"

## Communication Types & Specific Guidance

### Sales & Proposals
- Begin with a personal connection point
- Highlight specific benefits using concrete numbers and percentages
- Structure with clear headings and bullet points
- Include clear next steps and calls to action

### Technical Support
- Acknowledge the issue promptly and with empathy
- Clearly explain technical issues in accessible language
- Provide timeframes for resolution when possible
- Offer workarounds when available

### Product Updates

- Explain the benefit of each feature, not just its functionality

### Internal Stakeholder Communications
- Be direct and factual about challenges
- Maintain professionalism even in disagreements
- Clearly articulate business impact
- Reference shared goals and mutual benefits
- Suggest specific, actionable solutions

## Language & Formatting Guidelines

### Vocabulary Preferences
- **Preferred Terms:** platform, solution, enhance, streamline, optimize, efficiency
- **Avoid:** product, tool, fix, make better, speed up

### Email Structure
- Begin with a personalized greeting
- Start with the most important information
- Use short paragraphs (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Employ bullet points for lists longer than 3 items
- End with a clear call to action or next step
